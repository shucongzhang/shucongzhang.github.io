I am a researcher at Toshiba Cambridge Research Lab. Before joining Toshiba I obtained my PhD degree from University of Edinburgh. My primary area of work is in automatic speech recognition (ASR). I am particularly interested in end-to-end ASR. 

Please see the publications page for a detailed publication list. A [CV](http://shucongzhang.github.io/files/shucong_cv_.pdf) is also avaliable.
